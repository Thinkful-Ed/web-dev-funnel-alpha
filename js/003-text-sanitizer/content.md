## <a name="problem"></a> Problem
The internet can be a negative place sometimes. Write a function that will help make the text that appears on a web page a little more positive. It should look for a given word within a text string and replace it with another word of your choosing.

The function should take 3 arguments: a text string, a string to look for within that string, and a string to replace that word with.

### Examples
```
websiteWordReplace("This is lame.", "lame", "great"); // Should return "This is great."
websiteWordReplace("This is cool.", "lame", "great"); // Should return "This is cool."
websiteWordReplace("I don't like cats and I don't like dogs.", "don't like", "love"); // Should return "I love cats and I love dogs."
```
